Solution was developed by Denis Melnik for Vinted.

During the development I have applied strategy and singleton design patterns. 
The solution concerns have been separated. 
I have used data transfer objects to transfer entities between application layers. 
The most challeging code part was the development of the discount rules with cache. 
I have also provided model view controller approach of the user interface, 
for the Vinted to evaluate my abilities to write code for the web. 
I have also developed unit tests for the solution. 
There were no impediments during the development of the solution. 
Thank you, and I am looking forward to sharing the knowledge and sharing my experience with You.
